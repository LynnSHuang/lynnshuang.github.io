### Education  
I graduated from Dartmouth College with a biology major and computer science minor, then worked as a research assistant at Wake Forest Medical Center in the Department of Biostatistical Sciences for three years. My three projects were:  
* Staging chronic kidney disease by looking at creatinine lab results. What stage is a patient in? When do they transition from one stage to the next?
* Phenotyping lung cancer using gene expression data
* Identifying pre-Alzheimer's patients for a lifestyle intervention study by the Alzheimer's Association
I recently started a new job at Blue Cross Blue Shield North Carolina as a Rotational Development Program Associate. I'll be rotating through three different divisions over the next two years. My first (and current) rotation is in Data and Analytics, where I will help model the progression of Type 2 Diabetes in our members.

### Where's Lynn?  
If I'm not busy doing stats homework, you can find me in the hiking and backpacking in the woods. Sorry if response times are slow; they haven't upgraded the bears with WiFi yet.
