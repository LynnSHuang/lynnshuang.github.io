Here's the link to the first blog post I made [Hello World!](https://lynnshuang.github.io/Hello-World/) To say the least, it's been a very eventful term and my perspective on many things (data science included!) has changed a lot.  

#### What (if anything) has changed about what you think a data scientist is and what they do?  
I've gotten to know the data scientists at my job at Blue Cross Blue Shield North Carolina much better, and also done a bit of data science work myself. My current project is trying to model diabetes progression in our members, using a combination of claims, prescriptions, lab results, vital signs, health risk assessments to identify pre-diabetic, diabetic, and diabetic + complications stages. I'm fortunate to have done a bit of disease modeling work previously at Wake Forest, but that was certainly much simpler! I can't believe I ever thought that data was messy; it's been such a mess trying to find which prescriptions and what amounts might count as diabetes usage or off-label usage. Turns out the role of a data scientist is truly the happy marriage of domain knowledge (I spent a week looking up drugs) and analytical skills.  
I haven't gotten to the data visualization part yet, but I think that will also be a big part in data science. How do you present your carefully curated results in the most digestible way, especially for non-technical "stakeholders"?  
I think I'd say my perception of a data scientist and what they do has broadened a lot. Maybe "jack of all trades" is a good way to describe it? It also makes me wish I'd learned more about neural nets or machine learning stuff. I only have one more class left in the Masters of Statistics, and I'm hoping to continue as a non-degree student again.   

#### What are your current thoughts in terms of using R for data science - do you think you'll continue to use R going forward?  Why or why not?
I will 100% be using R in the future! I'm just not sure exactly when. I'm so comfortable in it right now, and I've learned capabilities for data visualization (ggplot, rshiny) and data analysis (goes really well with the ST563 class and the models we covered there).  
Most of my work right now is in SQL, because we're still pulling different types of data from a database. I imagine the meat of the analysis will be done in Python, because that's the most commonly used by other data scientists in my division. Plus, there's something about Python being most scalable for writing batch jobs and sending them off to a server? Or so I'm told.  
There was some disease progression work done by our summer interns about congestive heart failure and coronary artery disease. Besides the SQL to pull the data, everything was coded up in R. I'm hoping to pick up where they left off, but life is so busy with other work. Please don't worry, though. R will always have a soft spot in my heaRt.  

#### What things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?
I'd certainly incorporate more R Markdown in my future R coding. It's so useful for providing context to the code chunks, and makes generating reports much easier than I thought. I can't believe I didn't spend the time to learn Markdown sooner. I'm also excited to use more ggplot for beautiful data visualizations, and maybe even provide user-friendly applets for other people to use. I'm so, so glad I took this class!
