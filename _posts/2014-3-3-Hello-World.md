title: Hello World!

I want to dedicate this first blog post to all the data scientists, statisticians, machine learning engineers, and other number-crunching super troopers out there. Number-crunching is hungry work, so here's some food for thought:
[This is the difference between statistics and data science](https://mixpanel.com/blog/this-is-the-difference-between-statistics-and-data-science/)
[Data Science vs. Data Analytics vs. Machine Learning: Expert Talk](https://www.simplilearn.com/data-science-vs-data-analytics-vs-machine-learning-article)
[Machine Learning Engineer vs. Data Scientist](https://www.springboard.com/blog/machine-learning-engineer-vs-data-scientist/)

What do you think being a data scientist is about?
A data scientist is a jack-of-all-trades. They have enough statistics, programming, and product knowledge to take large amounts of data and digest it into data-driven models. Maybe "data whisperer" is a cooler name?

What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?
Three major knowledge areas:
1. Statistics and mathematical know-how: A good foundation in the theory of statistical models (which model should I use? what are its pros and cons?)
2. Hacking know-how: Python and R seem to be the most popular languages in data science job postings, but I don't think any specific language is much better than others. What matters more is familiarity with your chosen language, and the ability to execute data cleaning, modeling, visualization, reporting, etc. as required by projects.
3. Product-specific knowledge: If you're a data scientist at Facebook, you need to know the secret sauce algorithm that generates the millions of dynamic news feeds every day. If you're a data scientist at a health insurance company, your goal might be looking for disease progression trends or analyzing claims for fraud.

What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?
There's a lot of overlap! I think going forward, data scientists and statisticians will continue working closely together. As fun as it may be to bicker over which is better, I think a well-rounded "data whisperer" should have footing in both worlds. Both fields deal with data and sifting signal out of noise. A statistician usually work on a single model and tweak it until no egregious violations of assumptions exist (like taking the log of response values to reduce non-constant variance). A data scientist might start with several different models and then select the best. The vocabulary differs a bit between the fields ("response" versus "label", "predictor" versus "feature") too.

How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?
It's kind of funny, actually. My first job post-undergrad was in the Department of Biostatistical Sciences at Wake Forest Medical Center, working mostly with biostatiticians and professors. My current job (4 years later) is at Blue Cross Blue Shield North Carolina in the Data & Analytics division, working mostly with data scientists and engineers. So, the answer is I don't really know if I can pick one side. It's got to be both.
